Office team
===========

The office team does most of the non-consulting work needed to run the day to day operations.

Things like:

-   Client invoicing and payment followup.
-   Course and event administration (setting up registration pages, handling customer inquiries, sending emails, etc).
-   Office management (making sure new people have keys, organising cleaning, ordering books, buy furniture and course materials, etc).
-   Organise events

These are just a few examples, not a complete list. The office team does *a lot* of stuff!

Who is the line manager of the office staff?
--------------------------------------------

Since the office team members are actual employees, someone needs to fulfill the equivalent of a line-manager role. They need someone to discuss things like salaries and vacations with.

We have an informal role for this. The office team have basically elected one of the consultants to fill an office manager role, a person who they trust (and who is happy to do the job). It's a part time job that he gets compensated for.

In comparison, the other Syncopaters (the consultants) don't have salaries and don't need a manager. In a sense, the customers set the salaries of the consultants, so it's rather automatic.

What about sales?
-----------------

The office team doesn't really do sales, although they indirectly support the sales process (for example by routing client requests, as per the [Muffin Protocol](muffin-protocol.html)). Sales is done mostly by the consultants themselves. See [Sales](sales.html).
