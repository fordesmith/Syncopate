Why Syncopate exists?
========================================

> Syncopate is a home for people who like to
> (a) bring new digital products to market that make the world a better place
> (b) help others to do this in the most effective way possible
> (c) be part of a consulting partnership

We value:

-   \*Community - We like to hang out with people who share our values
-   \*Freedom - We want to control our own time
-   \*Competence - We want to continuously learn
-   \*Good citizenship - Heart over wallet (money isn't the main thing in life)
-   \*Professionalism - We genuinely care about solving our customers problems

We believe these values lead to personal happiness as well as business success.

Basically, we're trying to find the magic balance between being someone who makes the world a better place, being an independent consultant (full freedom, no support), and being an employee (little freedom, lots of support).

We based the idea of Syncopate on Crisp, a Swedish consulting company. We cloned their DNA! Want to start a similar org? See [How to clone the Crisp DNA](how-to-copy.html).
