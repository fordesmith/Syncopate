Why does Syncopate exist?
========================================

> Syncopate is a home for people who like to challenge the status quo and improve human potential to create a better world. 
We do this by uncovering and developing digital innovations, ways of working and human talent and using them to further our clientâ€™s success. We work collaboratively with our clients on their most ambitious challenges to deliver lasting change that matters. 

We value:

-   \*Community - We like to hang out with people who share our values
-   \*Freedom - We want to control our own time
-   \*Competence - We want to continuously learn
-   \*Good citizenship - Heart over wallet (money isn't the main thing in life)
-   \*Professionalism - We genuinely care about solving our customers problems

We believe these values lead to personal happiness as well as business success.

Basically, we're trying to find the magic balance between being someone who makes the world a better place, being an independent consultant (full freedom, no support), and being an employee (little freedom, lots of support).

We based the idea of Syncopate on Crisp, a Swedish consulting company. We cloned their DNA! Want to start a similar org? See [How to clone the Crisp DNA](how-to-copy.html).
