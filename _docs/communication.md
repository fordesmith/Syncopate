Communication
=============

Our **main internal communication channels** are:

-   [Unconference Meeting](unconference.html) twice per year.
-   Sync Up meetings (or mini-conferences). These happen about twice per year, in between the unconference meetings. Typically a half day or whole day with some kind of theme, like "how we make decisions" or "how we handle conflict" or "how we run courses".
-   Team mailing list - a single mailing list with everyone on it. We use simple [email conventions](email-conventions.html) to separate must-read stuff from general discussions, and the [Muffin protocol](muffin-protocol.html) to route client inquiries to the right consultant.
-   ["official" Board meetings] every month.
-   [Slack](http://www.slack.com) for chattier stuff (previously Skype)

Most decisions are made, and most problems solved, in one of the above forums.

Where we **store info**:

-   Google Docs - we used it for almost everything now a days. 
-   Google Drive - we have a  account that we used for shared docs that don't fit in google docs.
-   GitHub - a github organisation account for shared code and, well, the Syncopate DNA that you are reading right now.

How we **communicate with the outside world**:

-   Our website - [www.Syncopate.com.au](http://www.Syncopate.com.au)
-   A mailing list for our customers and course participants, we send information about upcoming courses about once or twice per quarter.
-   Twitter - our twitter handle is [@Syncopate](https://twitter.com/Syncopate/)
-   [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Syncopate.se)
-   ... but the biggest channel of communication is of course the personal and informal channels - Syncopateers tweeting, blogging, and talking to friends and customers. Together we have a huge network!
